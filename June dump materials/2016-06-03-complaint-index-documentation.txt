How I compiled the complaint index:

1. I visited http://portal.iprachicago.org/ in Chrome browser Version 49.0.2623.112 (64-bit) on June 5 and June 8, 2016.

2. I clicked the top-right dropdown menu (under the blue "Viewer Discretion Advised" box) to "Show All entries" to display all entries.

3. I highlighted the table of entries and copied-and-pasted them into an Excel workbook as plain text. This captured the fields Log#, Incident Types, IPRA Notification Date, and Incident Date & Time. To match the existing Invisible Institute GitHub data file field names and field-name style, I renamed these COMPLAINT_NUMBER, INCIDENT_TYPE, NOTIFICATION_DATE, and INCIDENT_TIME_START. I looked at one sample entry to confirm that the Incident Date & Time is the INCIDENT_TIME_START and not the time the incident ended.

4. I clicked each Log# hyperlink to view each individual entry, gathered the content from each entry, and added that content to the Excel workbook beside the corresponding data pasted in step 3:

The IPRA site uses the headings "Subject" for one subject involved in a complaint and "Subjects" with a bulleted list for multiple subjects. I copied-and-pasted the names listed into the Excel workbook in 4 fields (SUBJECT_1, SUBJECT_2, SUBJECT_3, and SUBJECT_4) to separate the individual names while keeping each entry on a single line. The most subjects any entry had was 4.

Some entries included notes saying files were withheld. I copied the entire note (except the introduction "Note:" that was only on some of them) into the Excel workbook as plain text (this lost some text formatting) and named this field DOCS_WITHHELD_NOTES. The reasons given for withholding files were either that a subject was a juvenile or the file content would violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), such as a 911 call that included private health information. I added the fields HIPAA_WITHHELD and JUVENILE_WITHHELD and marked them TRUE if the note indicated files were withheld for the corresponding reason. I marked these fields FALSE if they didn't apply in order to avoid blank fields. If there was only 1 subject for an entry, and that subject was a juvenile, there were no media files attached to the entry. However, if there were 2 or more subjects for an entry, and 1 subject was a juvenile, there were files attached but not personal files related to the juvenile.

While I was looking at each entry, I visually counted the number of media files and recorded these in the fields VIDEO_COUNT, AUDIO_COUNT, and DOCUMENT_COUNT. I typed "0" when there were no attached files of each type to avoid blank fields and aid statistical analysis like averaging.

5. On June 25, 2016, I followed steps 1, 2, and 3 and pasted today's "new" table of entries into a temporary Excel worksheet beside the existing "old" table of entries. I created and dragged down an Excel equation subtracting the "new" complaint numbers ("CRIDs") from the "old" complaint numbers to identify complaints that had been added to the IPRA portal since June 8, 2016. I identified 5 "new" complaints and followed steps 1-4 to add these new complaints to my working Excel file. Then I saved the worksheet as a csv, opened it in TextEdit, and pasted the new comma-separated lines into GitHub, initiating a Pull Request to merge the updates into the master branch.
