# OUR WORKING DEFINITIONS

__COMPLAINT_NUMBER:__
+ Unique identifier for an incident.

+ Synonomous with CRID (Complaint Register ID) and Log #.

__BEAT:__
+ A police beat is an area.
+ Described by integer up to 4 digits.
+ A beat is a subset of a district.
+ The first two digits of a beat represent the District:
  + ___EXAMPLE:___ Beat 0715 is in District 7

__STREET:__

__ADDRESS:__
+ Address of the incident

__LOCATION_CODE:__
+ Where the incident occurred: "Street", "Alley", "Apartment", "CTA" . . .

__INCIDENT_TIME_START:__
+ When the incident began.
+ ___Data quality issue:___ Time encoded in many different formats.
+ ___Data quality issue:___ Many rows are missing this value.

__INCIDENT_TIME_END:__
+ When the incident ended.
+ Same data quality issues as above.

__NOTIFICATION_DATE:__
+ We are assuming that this means when the complaint was reported to IPRA

__ACCSUEDOFFICER_FNAME:__
+ First name of accused officer.

__ACCUSEDOFFICER_LNAME:__
+ Last name of accused officer.
+ __Data quality issue:___ We don't have middle names. This is far more important than it might sound, because many officers share the same first name, last name combination across the system. (Common names, family relationships, etc.) Missing middle names makes it harder to identify officers.
